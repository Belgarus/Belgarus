## 💫About Me:
I'm a frontend Developer also intrested in Computer Siense & Ethical hacking.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) and a [Computer Sience crash curse](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&si=a56ttV0UDTmekoat).

- 👩‍🦯 Another awesome project I contributed to was [DVBerry](https://github.com/Julius-Babies/JH_DVBerry) – an app designed to help blind people navigate the VVO public transport system.
