🧙‍♂️ Hi, I’m a **JavaScript Developer** with a passion for Webdevelopment, Electronics and Cyber Security.

*  I'm currently doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist in system integration, learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) and taking [Hack the Box](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) curses.
*  I worked on the frontend and backend in two exciting projects: the [Communardo IT Camp](https://github.com/IT-Wintercamp-2025) and [DVBerry](https://github.com/Julius-Babies/JH_DVBerry), an app that helps blind people navigate in the VVO transit system.
